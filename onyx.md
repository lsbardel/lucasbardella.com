Hi Ishaan,

Thanks again for getting the offer organized so quickly. I'm getting quite excited about joining the new team and the prospect of making a significant impact on the business.

I have carefully reviewed the contract offer, and I have a few questions.
i) The contract outlines the hours of work from 8 am to 6 pm, can this be changed to 9 am to 6 pm? I'm asking because it is unlikely I'll be in the office before 9 am as the commute is not straightforward, and I'll try to squeeze a gym session in before work.
It also means 9 hours rather than 10 "normal" hours of work which is more in line with the industry standard.
ii) Pension contributions are not clearly mentioned in the contract, it just states that the company will make the minimum contribution by law (which is 3% as of now). Is this a correct assumption? If this is the case, are contributions increasing after probation? I'm asking because I consider this a very important benefit.
iii) Working remotely is not mentioned in the contract; what is the company policy on this? I'm asking because I'd like the flexibility to be able to work from home or other places occasionally.
