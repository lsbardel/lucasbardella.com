The HTML custom data attribute `data-*` has become one of the most important parts in modern
front-end development, especially since [HTML5][] has become the de-facto
standard mark-up language for the world wide web.
This attribute is extremely useful because it allows one to inject custom data values
directly into the [DOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) tree.

It is intended for use by the site's own scripts, for example:

```html
<div class="user" data-username="pippo" data-email="pippo@pippo.com"></div>
```

Before this important change in the mark-up language, developers could not add
data to the DOM in a clean and elegant way. Instead they were forced to use all
sorts of hacks and tricks to get the job done.

## Specification

Each custom `data-*` attribute is valid if the `name` replacing the `*` follows
these rules:

- it must not start with `xml`, whatever case
- it must not contain any semicolon
- it must not contain spaces

These attributes are converted into a dictionary like container of
`String` key and `String` value
pairs called the [DOMStringMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/DOMStringMap).
The conversion follows these rules:

- any dash (U+002D) in the `name` is removed
- any letter following a dash, before its removal, is set in its upper case counterpart

In other words, the `data-date-of-birth` attribute becomes the
`dateOfBirth` key in the data container.

I'm not sure why the decision to change the attribute names to their
[camel-cased](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) versions was taken,
I'm not sure it is the right decision, but it is a decision
we can live with.

Another important fact to notice is that you don't need to set a data attribute to a given value,
instead you can simply add the attribute to the element:

```html
<div id="test" data-an-empty-name></div>
```

The value associated with the above data attribute is an empty string:

<div id="test" data-an-empty-name></div>

```javascript
const el = document.getElementById("test");
const data = JSON.stringify(el.dataset, null, 2);
el.appendChild(document.createTextNode(data));
```

## Javascript plugins

Several JavaScript library/plugins use the custom data attribute to activate
their API and to obtain configuration options.
For example, the popular [bootstrap][] library can
be used through the markup API without writing a single line of JavaScript.

By setting:

```html
<div id="carousel1" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
  ...
</div>
```

A carousel is activated.

<div style="width: 100%; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding-top: 80%">
<iframe src="{{ bundleUrl }}/blog/how_the_html_data_works/carousel.html" title="Bootstrap carousel"
style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; bottom: 0; top: 0; right: 0; left: 0; border: 0"></iframe>
</div>

## Data driven documents

Another important use of the data attribute is with JavaScript libraries such as [d3](https://d3js.org/):

> D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

> d3js.org

Lets take this example:

```html
<div id="barchart" data-values="[45, 63, 7]"></div>
```

<div id='barchart' data-values='[60, 140, 25]'></div>

The following script generates the bar chart above:

```javascript
notebook.require("d3-selection").then((d3) => {
  const chart = d3
      .select("#barchart")
      .style("text-align", "right")
      .style("color", "#fff"),
    data = JSON.parse(chart.node().dataset.values);

  chart
    .selectAll("div")
    .data(data)
    .enter()
    .append("div")
    .style("width", (d) => `${d}px`)
    .style("background", "#007d1c")
    .style("margin", "1px")
    .style("padding", "3px")
    .text((d) => d);
});
```

And that is all.
