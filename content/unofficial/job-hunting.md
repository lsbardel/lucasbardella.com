## My Current Situation

I left Onyx on July 14th.
I have a non-compete clause that prevents me from working for a competitor for an additional 6 months. These competitors are well-defined and only include the major commodity trading houses, so let's avoid those.
I can work for anyone else immediately either via my Limited company or as an employee.

## Why I left Onyx?

* I set out to build a trading platform for OTC commodity derivatives, and I did that.
* The OTC platform saved the company around 1.5mil in fees for the first 6 months
* The company is now moving in a direction that doesn't fully align with my interests
* We left in good terms and I can go back there as consultant if I want to
* I'm looking to work in a company where technology is a way of thinking and not just a tool - at Onyx technology wasn't really part of the culture
* I'm looking to actively work in trading technology, algo trading and low-latency trading, which is my passion
* I'm currently working on my crypto trading engine, event-driven and volatility arbitrage strategies


## What am I looking for?

* Hands-on lead role, not a pure management role
* I'd like to focus on algo trading, which is my passion
* Focus on low-latency trading, hopefully HFT where microseconds matter
* Hopefully use Rust and Python
* Looking for a company where technology is a way of thinking and not just a tool
* I would like some exposure to DeFi, but this is not a must-have
* I'm open to contract roles too, via my own company [quantmind](https://github.com/quantmind)
* In London or remote (UK or EU time zone)


## What can I offer?

* Over 20 years of experience in quantitative finance
* Over 8 years of experience in the algo trading space
* Started coding Python in 2006 and never stopped
* Started coding Rust in 2018, and I'm loving it
* Experience in leading engineers and quants since 2015
* Experience in building single-dealer (OTC) trading platforms
* Knowledge of crypto, commodities, fixed-income & FX markets


## What are my expectations?

The type of job is the most critical factor for my next role. The second most important factor is the compensation.

* I'll give you my salary expectations over the phone/email (that's a bit personal)
* I'm looking for a role with **skin-in-the-game**, so it must include either a cash bonus or an equity scheme or token allocation that matches my salary expectations so that my interests align with the company's interests.
