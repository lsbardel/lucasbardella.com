## My Current Situation

I'm still working at Onyx as of now ${nowTxt}.

My notice period is 3 months, and I have a non-compete clause that prevents me from working for a competitor for an additional 6 months after I leave. These competitors are well-defined and only include the major commodity trading houses, so let's avoid those.

<hr/>

## Why am I looking for a new role?

I am looking for a new role because I am looking for a new challenge.

I have been working at Onyx since October 2023, where I assembled a small team and I developed the trading platform for OTC commodity derivatives, including their hedging strategies. The platform is built with Rust, Python and Typescript.

The platform has been live for almost a year now, and although there are still things to do, I feel that I have accomplished what I set out to do, and the time is right to move on, given the current direction of the company doesn't fully align with my interests.

<hr/>

## What am I looking for?

* Hands-on lead role, not a pure management role
* I'd like to focus on algo trading, which is my passion
* Focus on low-latency trading, hopefully HFT where microseconds matter
* Hopefully use Rust and Python
* Looking for a company where technology is a way of thinking and not just a tool
* I would like some exposure to DeFi, but this is not a must-have
* I'm open to contract roles too, via my own company [quantmind](https://github.com/quantmind)
* In London or remote (UK or EU time zone)


<hr/>

## What can I offer?

* I have over 20 years of experience in quantitative finance
* I have over 8 years of experience in the algo trading space
* I started coding Python in 2006 and never stopped
* I started coding Rust in 2018, and I'm loving it
* I have experience in leading engineers and quants since 2015
* Knowledge of the commodities, fixed-income, FX and crypto markets


<hr/>

## What are my expectations?

The type of job is the most critical factor for my next role. The second most important factor is the compensation.

* I'll give you my salary expectations over the phone/email (that's a bit personal)
* I'm looking for a role with **skin-in-the-game**, so it must include either a cash bonus or an equity scheme or token allocation that matches my salary expectations so that my interests align with the company's interests.
