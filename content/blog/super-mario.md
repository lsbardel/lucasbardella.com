A few years ago, [Mario Draghi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Draghi) was the hero of the European Union. He saved the Euro and the European economy. But really, he's not an hero, he's a pro.

This post is just my way to say "thank you" to him. I'm not a huge fan of politics, but I'm a fan of people who do their best to make the world a better place.
