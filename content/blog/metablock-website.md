Finally I managed to move my old website into a new cloud infrastructure I've been working for over two months.
The new website is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and
the typescript tooling from [metablock-js](https://github.com/quantmind/metablock-js).
The source code for the website is available on [github](https://github.com/lsbardel/lucasbardella.com).

[Metablock](https://metablock.io/) is a serverless cloud platform under development and looking for investment!
