## Location

I'd like to have a place with the following characteristics:

* near the sea
* near a city/town with good amenities
* good internet connection
* warm weather

## Accommodation

I will be staying in Italy for 6 months, so I need to find a place to live. Options include:

* long-term AirBnB rental
* short-term rental through a local agency

## Transportation

I'll need a car to get around, options include:

* buy a second-hand car in Italy
* rent a car on a medium-term lease
* use taxis/public transport only when necessary and use an eBike for local trips


## Practicalities

* A local eSIM card for my phone so I can use both my UK and Italian numbers
* A broadband connection not depenednet on the accommodation provider
  - e.g. a 4G/5G router with a local SIM card
  - starlink?
