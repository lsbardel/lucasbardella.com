This post is about my job hunting in 2025. If you are reading it, it means I gave you the link so that we can work together to land me the best gig possible.

My aim is to give you an introduction to myself so that we minimize the time wasted during the initial interview process.

## My Current Situation

I'm still working at Onyx as of now ${nowTxt}.

My notice period is 3 months, and I have a non-compete clause that prevents me from working for a competitor for an additional 6 months after I leave. These competitors are well-defined and only include the major commodity trading houses, so let's avoid those.

<hr/>

## Why am I looking for a new role?

I am looking for a new role because I am looking for a new challenge. I have been working at Onyx since October 2023, where I developed the trading platform for OTC commodity derivatives, including their hedging strategies. The platform is built with Rust and Python.

The platform has been live for a few months now, and although there are still things to do, I feel that I have accomplished what I set out to do, and the time is right to move on.

<hr/>

## What am I looking for?

* Hands-on role, not a pure management role
* I'm looking for a new challenge in the algo trading space.
* I'm looking for a role where I can lead a team to develop and manage algorithmic trading strategies
* Happy to work for Hedge funds, trading houses and crypto trading shops
* I'm looking for a role where I can use Rust and/or Python
* Not a fan of working for banks
* Not keen on small startups with less than 10 million in funding or a runway of less than 2 years
* I'm open to contract roles too, via my own company [quantmind](https://github.com/quantmind)
* In London or remote


<hr/>

## What can I offer?

* I have over 20 years of experience in quantitative finance
* I have over 8 years of experience in the algo trading space
* I started coding Python in 2006 and never stopped
* I started coding Rust in 2018, and I'm loving it
* I have experience in leading engineers and quants since 2015
* Knowledge of the commodities, fixed-income, FX and crypto markets


<hr/>

## What are my expectations?

The type of job is the most critical factor for my next role. The second most important factor is the compensation.

* I'll give you my salary expectations over the phone/email (that's a bit personal)
* I'm looking for a role with **skin-in-the-game**, so it must include either a cash bonus or an equity scheme or token allocation that matches my salary expectations so that my interests align with the company's interests.
