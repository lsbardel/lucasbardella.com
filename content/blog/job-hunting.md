## CV

You can download the CV pdf from there if you prefer.

## My Current Situation

I'm still working at Onyx as of now ${nowTxt}.

My notice period is 3 months and I have a non-compete clause that prevents me from working for a competitor for additional 6 months after I leave. These competitors are well defined and only include the major commodity trading houses. So, lets avoid those.

<hr/>

## Why am I looking for a new job?

I am looking for a new job because I am looking for a new challenge. I have been working at my current job since October 2023 where I developed the OTC trading platform for OTC commodity derivatives, including the hedging strategies associated with them.

The platform has been live for few months now and, although there are still things to do, I feel that I have accomplished what I set out to do and the time is right to move on.

## What am I looking for?

* I'm looking for a new challenge in the algo trading space.
* I'm looking for a role where I can lead a team to develop and manage algorithmic trading strategies
* Happy to work for Hedge funds, trading houses and crypto trading shops
* Not a fan of working for banks
* I'm looking for a role where I can use Rust and/or Python

<hr/>

## What can I offer?

* I have over 20 years of experience in quantitative finance
* I have over 8 years of experience in the algo trading space
* I started coding python in 2006 and never stopped
* I started coding Rust in 2018 and I'm loving it
* I have experience in leading engineers and quants since 2015
* Knowledge of the commodities, fixed-income, FX and crypto markets

## What are my expectations?

The type of job is the most important factor for my next role. The second most important factor is the compensation.

* I'll give you my salary expectations over the phone/email (that's a bit personal)
* I'm looking for a role with **skin-in-the-game**, so it must include either cash bonus or equity scheme or token allocation that matches my salary expectations so that my interests aligns with the company's interests
