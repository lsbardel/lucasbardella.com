description: A list of crypto companies I came across during my job hunting in 2025.

Summer of 2025 and I've been looking for a new gig.
After working at Onyx for almost two years, the time was right to move on.

I've decided that crypto is the place to be, especially after the recent developments in the geopolitical landscape.
Trump, tariffs, dollar taking a hit, abundant inflation and so on.

This is an alphabetical list of crypto companies I came across during my job hunting in 2025.
I did not apply to all of them, infact very few of them, but I discussed them with various recruiters.

* [Aneralabs](https://aneralabs.xyz/)
* [Backpack](https://backpack.exchange/)
* [Blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/)
* [Flow Traders](https://www.flowtraders.com/)
* [Flowdesk](https://www.flowdesk.co/)
* [Gattaca](https://www.gattaca.com/)
* [Kappa lab](https://www.kappalab.io/)
* [Keyrock](https://www.keyrock.eu/)
* [lo.tech](https://lo.tech/)
* [Selini Capital](https://www.selinicapital.com/)

It is difficult to keep recruiters at bay, they just want to fill positions.

So, when you talking to them, keep this in mind, only apply to what makes sense to you and not what they say.
